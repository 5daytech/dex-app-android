We believe that private property is untouchable and market access is unconditional.

That is why we engineered a crypto exchange that is equally open to all, lives online forever and unconditionally protects your assets.

It is fully peer-to-peer and works without any centrally managed servers. It can't be stopped, blocked or taken down.

Such approach enables the wallet to operate anywhere and remain censorship-resistant. Only the user is in control of the money.
